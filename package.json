  "description": "This is a restaurant reservation application that allows diners to book  reservations at restaurants (e.g., https://www.chope.co). Restaurants can advertise their availability (e.g., cuisine type, branch locations, opening hours, menu prices) and diners can search for  restaurants to book reservations by providing various information (e.g., date and time, cusine  type, number of people, budget, preferred locations) and rate restaurants based on their dinning  experience. Each booking can be confirmed based on various criteria (e.g., booking time, availability, number of diners). Dinners could cancel or make changes to their reservations. The system could provide  various incentives (e.g., award points for each confirmed booking) to retain users. Each user has an  account, and administrators can create/modify/delete entries.",
